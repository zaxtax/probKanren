Probabilistic programming is sometimes described as a generalisation
  of logic programming where instead of just returning a set of facts
  that answer a given query, we return a probability distribution over
  facts that answer a given query. But many contemporary probabilistic
  logic programming languages are not implemented as simple extensions
  of existing logic programming languages but instead involve their
  own unique implementations. Here we introduce probKanren, a simple
  extension to miniKanren that transforms
